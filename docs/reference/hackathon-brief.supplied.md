# Flare Summer Signal — VeilBid Competition Brief

> Derived from the project-owner-supplied
> [`original/hackathon-brief.md`](original/hackathon-brief.md). This file converts the supplied competition text
> into release requirements. Dates and prize figures are retained for reference,
> but the engineering plan is gate-driven and does not depend on the deadline.

## 1. Competition fit

Flare Summer Signal accepts products built from scratch, existing projects, and
ports to Flare. VeilBid is an existing confidential-procurement product being
substantively rebuilt for Flare rather than merely changing its network.

The supplied brief defines two bounties:

| Bounty | Supplied prize pool | VeilBid strategy |
|---|---:|---|
| Interoperable Asset Products | $6,000 | Enter only after the XRP → FDC/Smart Account → FAssets escrow → award → redemption lifecycle passes |
| Confidential Compute Apps | $6,000 | Primary bounty; FCC private intake and winner computation are mandatory |

Each supplied bounty lists first place at `$4,000` and second place at `$2,000`.
Prize information is planning context, not a repository release fact.

## 2. Supplied timeline

| Milestone | Date in original brief |
|---|---|
| Registration and development open | June 29 |
| Final submission | August 14 |
| Judging | August 15–21 |
| Winner ceremony | August 24 |

Per project direction, these dates do not control engineering scope or quality
gates. Before any external submission, confirm the current schedule through the
organizer channel.

## 3. Required submission package

| Supplied requirement | VeilBid authority | Release condition |
|---|---|---|
| Project name | `README.md`, `docs/product-plan.md` | Exact name agrees everywhere |
| Selected bounty/bounties | `README.md`, `PLAN.md` | Primary FCC; interoperability only after its evidence gate passes |
| Short description | `README.md`, final submission material | Explains user problem and result in plain language |
| Target user | `docs/product-plan.md` | XRP treasuries, Flare treasury teams, and vendors are explicit |
| Demo/video/app | `PLAN.md` Phase 8 | Live Coston2 app, wallet-free tender, and four-minute video |
| GitHub/technical material | Repository and canonical docs | Judge-friendly source, setup, architecture, security, and verification |
| Meaningful Flare usage | Architecture and release evidence | FCC, FAssets, FDC, FTSO, and Smart Accounts form one flagship journey |
| New/ported/integrated/improved work | `docs/verification.md` new-work ledger | Commit- and evidence-backed separation from Sepolia/Nox baseline |
| Contract/deployment details | Verified Coston2 manifest | Addresses, extension/code/machines, transactions, and source/runtime mapping |
| Roadmap/next steps | `PLAN.md` and final submission | Credible audit, liveness, mainnet, and pilot work only |

## 4. Encouraged product-distribution evidence

The supplied brief encourages deployment network, acquisition, distribution,
testing, feedback, usage, community interest, pilots, and partner conversations.
VeilBid therefore requires:

- an explicit Coston2/Songbird/Flare deployment statement;
- at least five structured XRP/treasury-user interviews;
- at least five vendor usability sessions;
- at least one honest pilot or design-partner attempt;
- a record of community/Telegram technical feedback;
- no invented usage, traction, partnership, or acquisition claim.

These targets are tracked in `PLAN.md` Phase 7 and
`docs/verification.md` Gate H.

## 5. Existing-project disclosure

The final submission must keep four categories separate:

| Category | VeilBid example |
|---|---|
| Existed before Summer Signal | Sepolia/Nox/Safe/ERC-7984 contracts, app, relay, bindings, and evidence |
| Newly built | FCC Go extension, private ingress, TEE receipts/quorum, Flare market, and Flare bindings |
| Ported | Public explorer, role-based UI shell, stateless recovery patterns |
| Integrated or improved | FAssets/FDC/FTSO/Smart Accounts, multi-criteria scoring, threshold agreement, and hardened domains |

Every final statement must link to commits, Coston2 evidence, or the historical
release authority. Reusing an old product is permitted; presenting old work as
new Flare work is not.

## 6. Judging criteria translated into product gates

### Product usefulness

VeilBid must solve the concrete problem of confidential vendor competition for
XRP/Flare treasuries, demonstrate complete buyer/vendor journeys, and record
real feedback. A protocol-only script does not pass.

### Flare integration quality

FCC must hold and evaluate private bid state in the settlement path. FAssets,
FDC, FTSO, and Smart Accounts must be necessary to the same XRP-native funding,
scoring, settlement, and redemption story. Decorative protocol calls do not
pass.

### Technical execution

The Coston2 demo, contracts, extension, private ingress, threshold result,
settlement, relay recovery, generated bindings, and wallet-free evidence must
work without mocks. Architecture and residual trust must be understandable.

### Evidence of new work

The new-work ledger must map pre-existing, newly built, ported, integrated, and
improved work to commits, deployments, and sanitized evidence.

### Clarity and future potential

A judge should understand the product in 30 seconds, verify the Flare path in
two minutes, and reproduce the public lifecycle from the repository. The
roadmap must describe credible audit, liveness, pilot, and mainnet work without
claiming those outcomes already exist.

## 7. Submission readiness checklist

- [x] Project name and bounty selection are consistent in the Flare judge package.
- [x] Product description and target users are understandable without protocol
  knowledge.
- [x] Live app, wallet-free demo, public evidence links, and the checked-in
  captioned demo video work; remaining user-validation evidence is tracked in
  `PLAN.md` Phase 8.
- [x] GitHub repository and technical materials are accessible to judges.
- [x] Every Flare integration is explained by user value and live evidence.
- [x] Existing/new/ported/integrated/improved work is separated in
  `submission/flare/NEW-WORK-LEDGER.md`.
- [x] Verified addresses, extension ID, code/image version, machine identities,
  transactions, and deployment network are included.
- [ ] User testing, community interest, pilots, and traction are reported
  honestly.
- [x] Roadmap and next steps do not exceed the threat model or evidence.

The checklist remains incomplete until the corresponding rows in
[`verification.md`](verification.md) pass.
